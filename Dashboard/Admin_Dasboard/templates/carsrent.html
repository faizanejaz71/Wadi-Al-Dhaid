                  Please review the following terms carefully before making a booking. By confirming your vehicle reservation, you agree to adhere to these conditions.
                  
                  Payment Terms
                  
                      Full payment is required upfront: 50% at the time of booking and the remaining 50% upon vehicle delivery.
                      Bookings are confirmed only after the initial 50% advance payment is received.
                      A copy of your ID card or passport is required for identity verification.
                  
                  Fuel and Mileage
                  
                      Fuel measurement starts and ends at our base station.
                      The vehicle must be returned with a full tank of fuel at the end of each day.
                      Route changes or alterations to the travel plan are not permitted once the booking is confirmed.
                  
                  Chauffeur Service
                  
                      All vehicles are chauffeur-driven; self-driving is not permitted.
                      Vehicles cannot exceed the rated capacity for passengers or luggage.
                      The vehicle must not be used for illegal activities.
                  
                  Additional Costs
                  
                      The rental fee does not cover costs such as airport fees, parking, tolls, and applicable taxes.
                      Cleaning fees may be applied if the vehicle is returned excessively dirty or stained.
                      For outstation rentals, return fuel and toll charges will be applied if the vehicle is not returned to Lahore.
                  
                  Driver Allowance & Holidays
                  
                      For overnight trips outside of Lahore, customers are responsible for covering the driverâ€™s accommodation and meals (Rs. 2,000 per night). A Rs. 500 meal allowance applies for trips within Lahore.
                  
                  Cancellations & Changes
                  
                      A 20% cancellation fee will apply if the booking is canceled (applicable if canceled within 48 hours of booking).
                      If the rental period is cut short, the daily rate may be recalculated, and full payment for one day, including fuel and driver costs, will still be charged.
                      Monthly rentals include six days of service per week and seven days of outstation travel within the agreed rate. Additional outstation days will incur separate charges.
                  
                  Responsibility & Liability
                  
                      Customers are responsible for safeguarding their personal belongings (phones, wallets, etc.). We do not assume liability for any loss or damage.
                      Drivers will assist with loading and unloading luggage, but the customer must be present when their belongings are being handled.
                      We reserve the right to substitute vehicles or drivers without prior notice.
                      In case of breakdowns, particularly during outstation trips, backup vehicles or drivers are not guaranteed. Fuel and toll costs for the return journey may apply.
                      We are not liable for delays caused by mechanical issues, misunderstandings, or unforeseen circumstances. While we may provide backup assistance, no compensation will be offered for delays.
                  
                  Prohibited Uses
                  
                      The transport of illegal items, weapons, drugs, or alcohol is strictly forbidden.
                      Customers will be held accountable for any legal or security issues that arise if the vehicle is used in a dangerous area or for unlawful activities.
                  
                  Driver's Responsibilities
                  
                      Drivers are responsible for safe and timely driving, maintaining vehicle cleanliness, handling luggage, and collecting payments.
                  
                  Disclaimer
                  
                      We are not responsible for delays or disruptions due to strikes, road closures, public holidays, or other unforeseen events. Any additional costs, such as tolls or fuel for alternate routes, are the customer's responsibility. We advise considering such factors when planning your trip, especially during peak periods. No refunds or compensation will be provided for delays caused by these circumstances.

                          For cancellations made less than 48 hours before the service start, 70% of the advance payment will be refunded, and a 30% cancellation fee will apply.
                      Last-Minute Cancellations (on the day of service):

                  Service-Related Refunds
